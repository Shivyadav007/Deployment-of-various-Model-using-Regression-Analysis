# Deployment-of-various-Model-using-Regression-Analysis
The main objective of this project is to perform a regression analysis on a dataset  to identify the relationship between the dependent and independent variables  and deploy the various models using Regression techniques [AIC, BIC , PRESS, Cp, MSE, Adj. R^2].
We aim to accomplish the following objectives:
● Identify the variables that are most strongly correlated with the dependent variable.
● Determine the significance of the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
● Develop a predictive model for the dependent variable using the independent variables vsing various feature selection criteria.
● Evaluate the model's performance and accuracy
